## Credit Scoring Model Development
## üîç Project Overview

Credit scoring is a crucial task in financial institutions for assessing the risk associated with lending decisions. This project aims to develop a machine learning-based credit scoring model that predicts the probability of a customer defaulting on a loan. 

## üéØ Objectives

Build a predictive model to assess credit risk for loan applicants.

Utilize feature engineering to enhance model interpretability and performance.

Compare multiple models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

Evaluate performance using metrics such as ROC-AUC, Precision-Recall

## Steps for Credit Scoring Model Development

1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection ‚Äì Use datasets like "Give Me Some Credit" (Kaggle).

2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing ‚Äì Handle missing values, encode categorical features, and scale numerical data.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) ‚Äì Visualize distributions, correlations, and feature importance.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Engineering

5Ô∏è‚É£ Model Selection ‚Äì Train Logistic Regression,

## Technologies Used

 Programming Languages
Python ‚Äì Primary language for data analysis and model development.

## Libraries & Frameworks

Data Processing & Exploration

pandas ‚Äì Data manipulation & analysis.

numpy ‚Äì Numerical computations.
